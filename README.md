# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many employees from PH were of retiring age as well as the departments and positions of these soon-to-be retired employees.  We used pgAdmin/SQL to create and join different csv files in order to get a clearer picture of the "silver tsunami".  We also used these tables and the data to find out which employees would be eligible for a mentorship program, so that there is a replacement plan in place.   

## Results

The results of the analysis are:
- There are 72,458 unique employees retiring.

- The "Manager" title has the least amount of employees eligible for retiring with only 2 employees.
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary

In conclusion there are 72,458 roles that will need to be fulfilled once the "silver tsunami" begins and ends.  There is not enough eligible employees in the mentorship program for a 1 on 1 mentorship, however, there are most likely some retiring employees that don't meet the eligibility requirments that would be willing to mentor younger employees for their role.  There are 5,860 employees eligible for retirement in the Sales department.  The total amount of salaries from all the retiring employees is $15,892,491,033.  That is a lot of money.
